# Computer-Graphics
This project is designed to create an editor similar to Microsoft Paint Editor.
I have collected the basic code somewhere else and extended it to add more functionality.
If you can't run this project (may be due to a path/directory issue), only look for "main.cpp".
Look the interface of the paint editor at a glance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gQr64rxkXo
